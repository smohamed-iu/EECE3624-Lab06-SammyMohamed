 *
 * This lab uses hardware LEDs wired to PORTA, an interrupt from the joystick center
 * button, and a timer interrupt to build a game loop program that can display 
 * different patterns on the LEDs.
 *
 * While there are many "down and dirty" ways to get this coding done, try to 
 * remember your coding and data structures classes.  Things like ENUM, Arrays, Functions
 * could help make for more elegant coding.

	LEDS = 0xFF;  // Set the PORTA for all pins to be high (i.e. OFF)
	//LEDS = 0x00;  // TEST - Set all PORTA pins to be low (i.e. ON)
	
	// Initialization for Timer Interrupt
	// With a 7.3MHz crystal we have a 0.137us period
	// To build a 1ms timer "tick" we
	// - set the pre-scaler to 1/64 (8.77us)
	// - set the TCNT1 to count 114 counts (0-114=0x8E)
	// - enable the interrupt on overflow
	// (Prof Note: these are the commands you need, BUT they are commented
	//  out to start.  Be sure you fully understand them (book, datasheet, etc)
	//  before you enable them...  You also have to have the proper ISR routine
	//  ready for this to work.)
	// (Prof Note Two:  You will need to show your own calculations in the 
	//  Lab Report to verify the TCNT0_COUNT_SET value!)

	// Port Initialization
	// Using the LED PORTA initilization above and your Lab05 code, 
	// Configure the joystick button.
	// (Prof Note: you will need to add another jumper wire, or 
	// change the ones you have, to get the center button working!

	// Interrupt Enable Block
	// Using your Lab05 code, you will need to update these
	// lines from 0x00 to have the appropriate mask.
